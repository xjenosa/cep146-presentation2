Slide 2 — What Is Vibe Coding?
Vibe coding is a term coined by ex–OpenAI developer Andrej Karpathy.
It describes a new workflow where humans focus on ideas, architecture, and feedback — while AI handles the literal code typing.

Instead of memorizing syntax or writing every line manually, you steer the AI, guide it, correct it, and shape the project using intuition and clear instructions.
It’s less like typing, more like conducting.



Slide 3 — Why Now?
To understand why vibe coding works, consider the pace of AI progress:
Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, said: “In 12 months, nearly all code may be generated by AI.”

And that’s already starting to show.
There’s a kid in San Francisco who won multiple hackathons despite having zero traditional coding experience — he simply vibe-coded, asking AI to generate ideas and code for him.



Slide 4 — Coding vs. Programming
A big part of this shift is understanding the difference between coding and programming.

- Coding is writing syntax correctly — telling the computer how to do something.
  In the past, an elite coder could type perfect C code at 100 wpm purely from memory.
  But today, large language models can generate correct syntax faster than a printer.

- Programming, however, is a much broader skill.
  It’s part art, part science — creativity, problem-solving, product design, debugging, and judgment.
  The best programmers spend more time removing code to improve performance than writing it.

You can ask an AI to spin up a full SaaS app — but protecting it from trolls, hackers, and abuse?
You only learn that through experience. People can max out your API keys, bypass your subscription paywall, or spam your database with garbage data.

So coding is being automated. Programming is not.



Slide 5 — So… Can Vibe Coding Work?
Yes — when done properly.
Here’s how.



Step 1 — Use an AI-Native IDE

Start with an IDE built around AI, such as Cursor or Windsurf.
These tools are designed for back-and-forth iteration and fast changes.



Step 2 — Choose a Simple, Popular Tech Stack

Use technologies the AI has seen millions of times:

- React
- Tailwind
- Firebase
- Next.js

AI IDEs excel at solving problems that many developers have solved before.



Step 3 — Use GitHub Version Control Constantly

Commit early and often.
Or automate your commits.
AI can occasionally overwrite or delete working code, and when that happens, it can be nearly impossible to prompt it back into existence.
Version control is your parachute.



Step 4 — Think Like a Product Manager

Instead of asking, “What can AI do for me?”
Ask, “What can I do to help the AI understand my goals?”

Break tasks into small pieces.
Give proper context.
Explain requirements clearly.
Treat the AI like a very fast but very literal intern.



Step 5 — Don’t Let the AI Get Creative

AI creativity is fun — until you need something to work exactly as intended.

Provide:
- specific documentation
- UI sketches or example images
- detailed acceptance criteria
- clear constraints

The more deterministic your prompts, the less chaos you’ll deal with.



Slide 6 — Congratulations!
You can now produce a mountain of failed side projects — just like the rest of us.
But among them, one might just hit.



Slide 7 — A Future Built on Vibes
It’s only a matter of time before we see a billion-dollar business built entirely through vibe coding.

And remember:
Some of the most efficient companies already do surprisingly much with surprisingly few people.
- Valve has one of the highest revenue-per-employee ratios in the industry.
- OnlyFans reportedly runs with around 40-ish full-time employees while generating enormous revenue.
Small, high-leverage teams — or even individuals — will have more power than ever.
